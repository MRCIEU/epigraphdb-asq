Here we briefly cover how to use the ASQ platform.

The primary use of ASQ is to extract claims from your input text on scientific literature findings,
and then for a claim of interest ASQ will retrieve evidence from
[EpiGraphDB](https://epigraphdb.org)
and harmonize them into various categories (by nature of the evidence source, by the relationship of the evidence against the query in terms of whether the evidence support the claim or not)
for evidence triangulation.

The rough steps for using the ASQ platform are as follows:

1. [Extraction of claims](#text-qeury)
1. [Harmonization of the query entities](#entity-harmonization)
1. [Retrieval of evidence from EpiGraphDB](#evidence-retrieval)

export const textQuery = `**Text query input**

export const claimEntitySelection = `**Select paired ontology entities for the claim triple**

export const evidenceSummary = `**Summary of the retrieved evidence**

export const evidenceGroup = `**Evidence group**
